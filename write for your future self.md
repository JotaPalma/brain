When we make [[fleeting note]]s, we often do so in a quick way, so we don't lose much time and our train of [[pensamento|thought]]. That's why we should revise them one or two days after [[writing]] them and either toss them or turn them into [[permanent notes]].

Make sure you explain why you're thinking in this way, what led you to your [[pensamento|thoughts]] and conclusions. Explain it as if your future self doesn't remember what you're thinking right now, because they probably won't.

This is to say, [[don't trust your present self]] either. Make sure you force yourself to write things in a concise way, as if you're explaining the topic to a novice.

Even if you're going to make your notes public, [[write for yourself]] first and foremost. This is to enrich you first, so write with your own [[mente|mind]] in mind.
