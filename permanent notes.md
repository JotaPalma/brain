# permanent notes

Permanent notes should be...permanent. They're ever changing, of course. The whole concept of the [[second brain]] is to add to the notes as you learn new information, and [[make connections]] that are new.

But you should [[write for your future self]], and keep things that will be useful to us.

Niklas Luhmen never tossed notes from his [[Zettelkasten]]. Some just didn't pop up/weren't relevant as often, if at all and were forgotten, just like a [[memory]] in a regular brain.

They should be written with an "ignorant" public in mind. In this case, the public is your future self. You shouldn't assume you'll know what you meant a month, year, decade ago. Writing [[atomic notes]] is important for our future self to undestand the [[pensamento|thought]] processes that went behind writing that note.
