[# The One-Touch Guide to Doing a Weekly Review: How I Go From Chaos to Clarity in 30 Minutes](https://fortelabs.co/blog/the-one-touch-guide-to-doing-a-weekly-review/)

Tags: [[organization]], [[journalling]], [[review]]

a review that is short, quick and easy to complete, takes only about 15-30 mins per week

- don't include things that are major financial decisions.

goals: 
1. clear your digital workspace
2. update your tasks
3. decide on your priorities

points:
1. email
2. calendar
3. desktop/downloads
4. notes
5. tasks

when you're focusing on each, focus ONLY on that.

it should work in a flow, dropping things from 1 to 2, etc.

# email
don't take action on emails for now, just touch each email once to decide what to do with it. either put something on your calendar, on your task manager, on your notes, or on a read later bookmark manager, or download an attachment to your downloads folder. achieve [[inbox zero]]

# calendar
scan two weeks into the past to see if there are actions you need to take based on what you've done. write down tasks, follow ups, appointments, etc.

next, scan 4 weeks into the future, to see upcoming events. check if you need to prepare for meetings, go shopping for birthdays or parties, or make other decisions

funnel things from your calendar to your tasks.

# desktop / downloads

quickly look at each file and decide what to do with it. throw it in the trash, add it to permanent file system or to your notes/resources manager.

the idea is to declutter the folder/desktop.

turn files into tasks or notes to be dealt with in the other steps

# notes

process your [[fleeting notes]] into [[permanent notes]] in your second brain. if you find any ideas or actions you should take, add them to your task manager.

# tasks
this is very close to the end goal: to have a list of tasks that probably represent the priorities for the following week.

process all your tasks, deciding what the next action is, making it very clear, what priority it is (only apply high priority if it *must* be done this week), and what project or life area it falls into (work, personal project, hobbies, health etc)

decide what you *can* take action on, what you *need* to take action on, and what you *want* to take action on. 

this completes the process. it's important to remember that the task list is the end point, not the starting point.
