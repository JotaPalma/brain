# Intermediate Packets
Source: [[ðŸ“¹ The Second Brain - A Life-Changing Productivity System]]

When you see an essay, you don't have a huge block of text. You've got small paragraphs or content blocks. Those are called intermediate packets.

Working the other way around: if you save tidbits of information from all the ideas you get and all the media you consume, eventually you'll have a big text, broken into [[atomic notes]], or intermediate package. That's why you [[read with a pen in your hand]], because having an amass of notes, it makes it easier for [[writing]] content.
