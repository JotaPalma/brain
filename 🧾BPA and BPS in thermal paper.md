[BPA and BPS in thermal paper](https://www.pca.state.mn.us/green-chemistry/bpa-thermal-paper)

receipts printed on thermal paper are coated in [[Bisphenol-A]] (BPA) or Bisphenol-S (BPS), which assist in the heat activating printing process

studies have shown that a thermal receipt can contain 250 to 1000 more quantity of those chemicals than a can of food or a water bottle

some manufacturers have begun removing BPA from their products and advertising them as BPA-free

studies found that cashiers have higher levels of BPA in their bodies as other people.


ways to reduce exposure to BPA and BPS as a cashier or a business owner:
- go paperless, by sending the receipts to your costumers via email or text
- use alternative receipt paper, that is "phenol-free" which don't contain those chemicals, but others which are safer for human health and the environment
- if possible, don't print and hand out receipts unless the costumer wants them
- avoid handling receipts more than necessary
	- avoid crumpling the receipt
	- hold it with just 2 fingers
	- fold it on itself, as thermal paper usually can only be printed on one side and that's the side with the higher concentration of chemicals
	- avoid holding receipts after using alcohol on your hands or when they're wet with water, grease or lotion
	- don't hand receipts to toddlers or babies
	- allow customers to tear their own receipts off the machines
	- don't put the receipts directly over the food
