# don't trust your present self

In the present, when you're receiving information via the media you're consuming, it might not be interesting to you in that moment, but it could be in the future. The reverse is also true. You might find something very interesting, but lose interest in the future.

Don't make your future self regret not having taken notes on something. It's better to take notes of everything you consume, and have it be irrelevant in the future than the opposite.

Don't trust your energy levels right now, nor your motivation. Trust your passions. Take notes about everything and put them on the [[second brain]]

And [[write for your future self]]

When weâ€™re bettering ourselves, itâ€™s to become a better person. We should do things for this new and better person weâ€™re becoming. Thatâ€™s why you donâ€™t trust your present self.
