science is difficult to understand. it's got implications, nuances, relations to other subjects and require some understanding and study to "fully" understand. After all, [[all new learning requires a foundation of prior knowledge]]. but most people don't want to go through all that trouble. [[you can't master everything]], but you can understand, in a very basic way, many different subjects spread throughout different fields of study. so, simpler explanations reach more people, but they're also very lacking, which can lead to [[misconceptions]].
