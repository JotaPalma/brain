# rereading
Source: [[ðŸ“• Make It Stick]]

Rereading is a [[study]] technique that involves rereading the same material again, often multiple times, in an attempt to make the material "stick" to your brain. In the short term, it can help with [[memory]], but on the long term, it isn't very effective for actual [[learning]].

Rereading is time consuming. Retrieving information right after acquiring is [[wasting time]]. It doesn't create durable [[memory|memories]], as it only focuses on focusing on the material long enough to pass a test.

It also involves [[self-deception]]. You think you've got [[mastery]] of a subject because you've seen it a few times and can recite the most important points, but that's not the case, as the amount of study time isn't a measure of mastery.
