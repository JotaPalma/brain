# text outline

I've never given much thought to the outline of a document, but if I actually want to get around to [[creating]] text at some point, I need to think of an outline so I can focus on one thing at a time, and know what to write (and what NOT to write) about at any given time.

It's also important to make an "evergreen" outline, since it's important when using a [[zettelkasten]] to write from the bottom-up, to change your way of thinking and the structure of a text as you go. [[note-taking]] is important in [[writing]] a text [[bottom up]]
