# invest in your future [[memory]]

Source: [[ðŸ“¹ Why I Have a Second Brain by Elizabeth Filips]]

Set your future self up for as much success, happiness and joy as possible, by giving them as many resources and connections as possible.

Work with your future self in mind, [[write for your future self]]

This way you're not starting from a blank page, you're [[creating from abundance]].

Be as clear as you can when [[note-taking]] and adding to the [[second brain]], since you need your future self to understand what you meant.
