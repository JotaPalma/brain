If you have a collection of notes (in this case, the [[second brain]]), you're never starting from a [[blank page]].

Whatever the topic, as long as it's within the scope of your interests, you can go to your notes and find whole lines of [[pensamento|thought]] related to that subject.

Even with "normal" methods of [[creating]], you never really start with a blank page. After all, [[all new learning requires a foundation of prior knowledge]]. You picked the subject to [[writing|write]] about because you knew *something* about it. You don't just pluck questions out of the air, they come from all the information you consume that is somehow related to the subject at hand.
