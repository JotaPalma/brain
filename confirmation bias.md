# confirmation bias
Source: [[ðŸ“• How to Take Smart Notes]]

Confirmation bias is the [[concept]] that makes you surround yourself by people who think like you *because* they think like you. It also tries to stop you from researching subjects or arguments that disprove or argue against your beliefs.

A way to stop this from affecting you and your work is to acknowledge that it exists. Then, like [[Charles Darwin]], you can actively write down and research things that contradict your current thesis

With the [[Zettelkasten]], we tackle this by turning the [[writing]] process "on its head" (writing from the [[bottom up]]), and by changing your priorities, from finding facts that confirm your own [[pensamento|thoughts]], to gathering any relevant information on the given topic, no matter whether it will support or disprove it.
