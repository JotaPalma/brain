[Learning how to read, by Niklas Luhmann](https://luhmann.surge.sh/learning-how-to-read)

Poetic, narrative and theoretical texts are supposed to be read in different ways.

Narrative texts are read linearly, as the text depends on the reader not knowing what is going to happen, it tells a story from beginning to end.

Poetry relies on not only structure, but word choice, rhythm, rhymes, stylistic choices that require the reader to have some [[short-term memory|short term memory]] in order to understand the whole picture of the poem and interiorize the message that the writer intended to pass on through the poem

Theoretical texts require even more nuance. They require not only [[short-term memory]], but [[long-term memory]] in order to understand the text and [[make connections]] to previously read texts. They are very varied in the way they are written, based on who is the author, in what conditions it is written and even the day in which it's written.

Translators deal with the issue of not being able to translate a theoretical text word for word, lest the meaning behind the text be lost. They need to make the decision of what will best translate the *essence* of the text in a way a beginner can understand.

Luhmann recommends that anyone who is interested in reading theoretical texts to learn as many languages as possible, to read as many unadultered texts and understand the original intention behind them.

An effective way of understanding theoretical text would be to [[note-taking|take notes]], not excerpts. By writing what you have read in [[your own words]], you learn to pay [[attention]] to the themes of a text and filter what is important from what is repetitive.

Another question: what to do with the written notes? To avoid being discouraged by writing only useless "garbage", we should focus on how we arrange our notes for later access. This will provide a structure for building a knowledge hub and serve as an incentive to keep consuming more texts. It's important to note that this only produces actual results in the long run, when actual connections are made.
