[The Barbell Method of Reading](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/barbell-method-reading/)

Implementing speed reading methods might help with how many books you read total, but it won't help with how much information you retain.

It's natural to want to find a balance between having a constant influx of information (reading a lot) and actually [[learning|learning]] something with the least amount of effort possible.

The barbell method was a term coined by Nassim Taleb [[research more]].

You read a first time and make marks of things you find noteworthy. And then read a second time, reading only the things you've marked.

On the second read through is when you [[make connections]], write notes and do all the thinking.

The article says there are four kinds of information in a book/article:
1. Useful and hard to understand
2. Useful and easy to understand
3. Not useful and hard to understand
4. Not useful and easy to understand

It suggests you should mark the useful and hard to undestand pieces of information, so you can read again and process.
