All artists steal. There are no original ideas, everything is a remix of different mediums and other people's ideas.

You consume media in the form of books, movies, shows, youtube videos, research papers, comics, articles, etc. and make your own assumptions based on them.

You should gather all the relevant info from each medium into [[litnotes]] and then distill them into [[atomic notes]] in your [[second brain]]. This way, you'll write things in [[your own words]]
