# retrieval practice
Source: [[ðŸ“• Make It Stick]]

As the name suggests, practicing the retrieval of information by your brain, before it is forgotten. It's a form of [[spaced repetition]], through flashcards, for example. It strenghtens the [[memory]], since [[retrieval interrupts forgetting]].

Thinking about what you did and what could have been done better helps you retain more information, and be able to recall it next time.

Repeated [[active recall]] helps the [[memory]] consolidate from short- to long-term.

When recall is spaced, it allows for some [[esquecimento|forgetting]] to happen between each [[testing]], and leads to stronger long-term retention and [[mastery]]
