To have a decent amount of notes in your zettelkasten/[[second brain]] to use, all you need is to annotate everything you consume.

Translate it into [[your own words]] and [[make connections]]

The arguments in your zettelkasten are shaped by your [[pensamento|thoughts]] and ideas, which in turn are shaped by the various media you consume. Hopefully, as your [[note-taking]] skills increase, your arguments will also be influenced by the notes themselves.
