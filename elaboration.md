# elaboration

When [[learning]], the [[concept]] of elaboration is the process of expressing material in [[your own words]], and connecting it to what you already know. It is summarizing someone else's work (or your own, when used in [[note-taking]]) and giving new meaning to the material by making it familiar to you.
