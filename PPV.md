## Pillars
Support beams that hold your roof up, supporting your life. They support your life and your aspirations.

## Pipelines
Databases that are in motion, where action and [[tracking]] happen. There is an action items DB, with bite-sized action items (tasks), and the other DBs work with it to help you grow as a person.

## Vaults
Where you store your knowledge management and resources.
