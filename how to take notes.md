Source: [[ðŸ“• How to Take Smart Notes]]

1. [[read with a pen in your hand]], and take [[fleeting note]]s of whatever you consume into an inbox. Don't focus on syntax or cohesiveness. Keep all notes in one inbox if possible, but if not, write wherever you can.
2. Make [[litnotes]] from stuff you consume. Try not to make direct quotes or write stuff down blindly. Use [[your own words]], and make sure you understand what you write. Make notes about the quotes you do keep. The litnotes will be your bibliography/reference system.
3. Make [[permanent notes]]. Develop them instead of just storing them. Think about where they fit with your existing knowledge, since [[all new learning requires a foundation of prior knowledge]], combine ideas so that [[emergence]] happens.
4. Add the permanent notes to your [[Zettelkasten]] or [[Second Brain]]. Try to establish many connections so that there aren't any orphaned notes. You can also add the entry to an [[index]] so you can find it later, together with related notes.
5. Develop your topics, questions and research projects from the [[bottom up]]. See wjay notes you have, what points are missing, and read more, take more notes.
6. Don't brainstorm for a new topic. Instead, look at what you already have and expand on it. New topics will arise naturally.
7. When [[writing]] a text about a subject, choose one you've got in your system. Lay down the relevant notes in front of you, so you can see what's there, what's redundant and what needs to be developed. Improve your ideas and arguments.
8. Turn the notes into a rough draft. Don't copy-paste. Instead, write them in your own words again, so that they're cohesive.
9. Edit and proofread. Tada, a manuscript is born!
