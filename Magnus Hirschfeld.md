Magnus Hirschfeld (1868 - 1935) was a Jewish gay sexologist who wore "women's" clothes and coined the word "transvestitism". He wrote and collected many texts about queer sexuality. His colleagues also performed gender affirming surgery.

In 1933, while Hirschfeld was away on tour, Hitler's brownshirts broke into his institute and burned his collection of literature, over 20k books, including many rare books that were hard or impossible to replace.

He studied medicine, and during his travels in Chicago, USA, he became involved in the queer subculture there. Finding the similarities between the communities of Berlin and Chicago fascinating, he developed his theory on the universality of homosexuality around the world.
