[From a professional chef to you: The tricks that anyone should know when they buy food](https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/jwjn2p/from_a_professional_chef_to_you_the_tricks_that/)

Tips about grocery [[shopping]] and [[cooking]]

### Legumes (beans, chickpeas, lentils)
- They are better bought dried. Cheap, long-lasting and nutritious.
- Soak legumes and put them in the fridge overnight
- Middle-eastern and African [[cuisine]] for ideas, for example: lentil soup or curry, hummus, falafel, chickpea shakshuka

### Grains and cereals
- Very versatile.
- Flour: pastry flour is low-gluten, bread flour is high-gluten, all-purpose flour is a middle ground.
- Rice: Long grain rice is more versatile and keeps better after cooking. It's a great staple but needs another side for nutrients
- Barley: high in protein and iron. Use in soups, roasted in tea or with rice.
- Superfoods are overpriced and usually are ethical nightmares.

### Fruits and vegetables
- Onions: store in dry, enclosed spaces. They're yummy, cheap and nutritious (look this up)
- Tomatoes: Canned tomatoes should have as little added salt and sugar as possible
- Potatoes: Store in dry, enclosed spaces
- Fruits are nutritious and delicious. Season fruit is cheaper. Preserve them if you can find them cheap.
- In the store, look for the veggie or fruit that nobody buys, and therefore is cheaper
- Frozen food is nutritious, cheap and frozen at peak ripeness.

### Proteins
- Buy meat the least processed way you can. Whole chickens and ground meats are best. Freezing your own meat is fine, but avoid any pre-frozen meats
- Treat meat as a luxury, not an essential, it can be exchanged for more veggies and grains
- Learn how to use the whole protein. Debone a chicken and make stock or soup. Fat can be rendered and used as oil, skin can be turned into chips, etc.

### Misc
- Instant ramen is awful for your health. A better and cheaper option would be a bowl of rice with soy, a fried egg and some frozen peas.
- Avoid overly processed foods
- Cheese is a luxury.
- Alcohol is a luxury.
- Make your own coffee, and stick it in a thermos.
