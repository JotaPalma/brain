# categories

In the original [[Zettelkasten]] method, there are no categories, as it's a way to separate the notes and avoid making connections that might escape you. If you put all notes into the same "box", you'll see more connections.

In other methods of [[note-taking]], creating categories might help, especially in the beginning. As the system evolves, though, these categories might prove themselves too broad and hard to make connections with.

One can create index notes to keep track of categories without actually separating the notes.

In my own method, the [[second brain]], I don't have categories, but do use them as "tags". Or, better yet, I use the category keyword to write about the connection between the category and the note.
