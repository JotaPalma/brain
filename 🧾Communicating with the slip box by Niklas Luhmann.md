[Communicating with the slip box by Niklas Luhmann](https://luhmann.surge.sh/communicating-with-slip-boxes)

Luhmann saw his slipbox as an entity separate from him, like a different person.
He states that [[it is impossible to think without writing]], an idea I've seen in other texts.

Creating a communication partner is something meant in the long term, must be open and not limited to one theme.

He decided on a structure that would not cause the problem of having to decide the placement of a new note, and that would not be an outline based on topic and subtopic. So he chose to number the notes in an easily visible place and never change the fixed structure.


This allowed for placing new notes attached to old notes, for example, 57/12 and 57/13, or even 57/12a or 57/12b1, etc. This allows to make notes related to other notes and even related to words inside notes, as well as allowing for referencing through the fixed number identification of each note.

He used key words in the notes, as well as index cards, to aid in referencing other notes or literature and articles

To achieve "independence" from the slip box, Luhmann states that first, a "critical mass" must be achieved. This process can take several years and, during this time, you can only retrieve what you put in. When it gets bigger and more complex, it can generate its own ideas. At some point, when you put in a new piece of information, it isn't isolated, but instantly [[make connections|making connections]] to other pieces of information.

When you put in a new piece of information, instead of isolating it with just one very specific [[keyword]], put in many general concepts to see how they interact with other notes.
