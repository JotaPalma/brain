Wanting your work to be decent is a good thing, but perfectionism is the enemy of getting things done. It usually leads to [[procrastination]].

I've struggled with this a lot. I want things to be done perfectly, because I only get to see other people's final product, and it seems perfect to me. So why should my thing be different?

When I think like this, I either overfocus on getting one task to be perfect, and forget all the other tasks that need doing, or I simply give up and don't even start.

I should stop wanting everything to be perfect, and start actually just completing tasks so I can move on to the next one. I want things to be done.
