Bisphenol-A, or BPA, is used largely in the inner liners of food cans, thermal paper, packaging, toys, kitchenware, etc.

human exposure to this chemical is usually oral, by inhalation or transdermal. it is metabolized in the liver to form bisphenol A glucuronide and is mostly excreted through the urine.

it is known to interfere with estrogen receptors, playing a role in the pathogenesis of many endocrine disorders, such as [[infertility]], precocious puberty, hormone dependent tumours (such as breast or prostate cancer) and metabolic disorders such as polycystic ovary syndrome [[PCOS]]


since we are exposed to BPA on a daily basis, it requires some monitoring, sch as clinical urine tests of concentration.
