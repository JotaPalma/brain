Doing a comprehensive review isn't good, overhauling your entire system every week is only going to end in chaos, not clarity.

The best thing to do is to clear your mind and set the tasks for the week.

Tiago Forte suggests doing a "one touch" approach to your 5 inboxes:
1. Email
	1. Clear inbox and capture new tasks or notes
	2. Don't take action: no replying to emails. Just decide what the actions are
	3. Reach inbox zero
	4. Take everything from the inbox to either a calendar, task manager, notes app or bookmarks app
		1. This makes the items roll into the other inboxes to be dealt with
2. Calendar
	1. Review recent and upcoming dates for new tasks and notes
	2. Look into things you should have done in the past and schedule a followup
	3. Look into things you've got coming up and create tasks for them
3. Desktop/downloads
	1. Clear desktop and downloads folder
	2. Everything you save to your desktop must either go into a relevant folder or be deleted
	3. If you save email attachments or other files into your downloads folder, it must also be sorted into the proper folders
4. Notes
	1. Clear notes inbox
	2. Create relevant tasks if that's the case
	3. Sort your notes into the second brain
	4. For me, this means sorting the Obsidian daily pages from the week, turning stuff into notes, and looking at raindrop.io
5. Tasks
	1. Clear task manager inbox and identify the week's tasks
	2. Make sure the task is clearly stated
	3. Add tags and priorities (only add top priority to things that MUST be done)
	4. Sort it into the project it falls into
	5. Assign days to focus on each task
