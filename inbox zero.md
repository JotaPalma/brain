# inbox zero
Source: Formação sobre gestão do tempo, em b-training

[[concept]] of starting the day/week/month with a clean workspace, so as not to be a tool for [[distraction]] and [[procrastination]].

It's usually applied just to the email inbox, but I find it works for other inboxes as well as the physical workspace we use.

When at work, don't check the email constantly. Schedule a reasonable amount of times to do it (once a day, once every hour, etc.)

If an email can be replied to in less than 2 minutes, do so immediately. This will free up mental space.

Use the folder/label function to separate emails into [[categories]].

Archive things you no longer need to see.

Create a category for emails you need to spend some time replying, or that will require your [[attention]] later.
