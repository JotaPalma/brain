[The Second Brain - A Life-Changing Productivity System](https://youtu.be/OP3dA2GcAh8)
By Ali Abdaal

1. [[Borrowed Creativity]]
	1. There are no original ideas. Everything is a remix of other people's ideas. add your own spin to things you consume
	2. if you have everything together in one place, it's easier to see the connections
2. The Capture Habit
	1. our brains are for having ideas, not storing them. ([[brains are for making connections, not storing information]]) catch the idea as soon as you get it. Just write it all down please, [[read with a pen in your hand]]
3. [[Idea Recycling]]
	1. ideas aren't single use. keep track of what you're creating, and reuse it when you need it. 
4. Projects over categories
	1. associate notes to specific projects, rather than folder categories, to avoid having lots of notes on the same subject, but nothing to do with them
		1. I wonder how this associates with [[categories are important]], and are they really?
5. [[Slow Burn]]s
	1. instead of doing "heavy lifts", where you go into a cabin in the woods and write for three weeks, do slow burns
	2. you have a list of projects in a slow burner. keep reading and developing the projects in small amounts at a time. before you know it you'll have finished projects
6. Start With Abundance
	1. you never start from scratch, you start from abundance. build a trove of info
	2. If you build a treasure trove of information by saving intermediate blocks of info on everything you consume, you'll be [[creating from abundance]]
7. [[Intermediate Packets]]
	1. "content blocks" form a bigger text. if you save the notes as intermediate packets, you can use them later (idea recycling) 
8. You Only Know What You Make
	1. you can consume all you want, but what's going to stick to your brain is what you do. 
	2. a book review, notes on other things, summaries, etc
9. Make it easier on your future self ([[write for your future self]])
	1. create things your future self will find helpful. write out notes in [[your own words]] on concepts and definition. Don't assume your future self will know what you mean.
10. Keep your ideas moving
	1. anti-perfectionist take. don't make everything perfect, just keep jotting down your thoughts and keep things moving. you'll improve the process and system itself over time ([[write imperfectly and efficiently]])
