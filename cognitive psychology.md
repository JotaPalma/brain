The science of understanding how the [[mente|mind]] works. Studies how [[perceção|perception]], [[memory]], [[thinking]] and [[learning]] work.


The scientific study of the [[mente|mind]] as an information processor, and its internal processes. Trying to build up [[cognição|cognitive]] models of the information processing that happens in the brain. Includes [[attention]], [[perceção|perception]], language, [[memory]], thinking and consciousness.

Based on two assumptions, which are occasionally debated

- Human [[cognição|cognition]] can, at least in principle, be fully revealed by the scientific method.

- Internal mental processes can be described in terms of rules or algorithms in information processing models.
