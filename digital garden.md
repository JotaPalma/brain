# digital garden

I first found about it on reddit (/r/Notion, and later /r/digitalgardens), but the concept seems underdeveloped.

The purpose seems to be to write [[atomic notes]] and publish them, so that everyone can see them. Some people even open up their gardens for others to edit them.

It has the purpose of functioning as an actual garden. You plant the seeds (which are [[fleeting note]]s), you water them by adding information to them, you weed them by [[making connections]]. Some will wilt away, and some will flourish and become trees.
