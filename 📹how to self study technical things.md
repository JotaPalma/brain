[how to self study technical things - Tina Huang](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_EzmbCuoFcU&ab_channel=TinaHuang)

1. learn just enough
2. do a project
3. iterate
4. accountability

there's too many information for technical knowledge, and it's hard to choose which course to take and how to apply it to real life, there's a lot of distance between beginner, intermediate and pro.

the best way to learn how to implement is to actually implement it. [[learn by doing]]. project-based [[learning|learning]] after [[learning|learning]] the basics.


iterate: choose another project to find the holes in your knowledge, and then fill those holes, and apply them in that project, and then rinse repeat.

accountability is the key to pushing through self doubt. take responsibility for your actions, and create consequences forwhen you're  wanting to fail or quit.

maybe making promises to finish a project, invest money in courses so you won't quit.

having a project before starting [[learning|learning]], so you know what the goal is and you can keep checking in with yourself and figure out what to do and learn next

take notes of the key concepts instead of taking very detailed notes. notes for how the info fits together. make connections.

use many resources instead of just one. no resource will have everything you need, so take information from many different places.
