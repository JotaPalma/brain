# retrieval interrupts [[esquecimento|forgetting]]
[[learning]] something is different that comitting it to [[memory]]. When [[study]]ing, if you decide to cram (by [[rereading]]) the information, you can probably remember it long enough to pass a [[testing]], but not long enough to pass the information into [[long-term memory]], where it can count as actual knowledge, contributing to [[mastery]] of the subject and [[make connections]] to your existing knowledge.

[[retrieval practice]] interrupts the process of [[esquecimento|forgetting]], which makes it easier to remember next time. You should recall right as you're about to forget, for maximum profit. This is also called [[spaced repetition]].

There are softwares designed for this. Anki is a good example.
