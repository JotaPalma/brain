After WWI, an open LGBTQ+ community flourished in Germany. Sodomy was still illegal, but the police didn't really care to enforce the law. Sexuality and gender was also seen as something fascinating and worthy of being studied, as opposed to a tabu and something to be cured (though there was still conversion therapy, etc)

[[Magnus Hirschfeld]] was a Jewish gay sexologist who wore "women's" clothes and coined the word "transvestitism". He wrote and collected many texts about queer sexuality. His colleagues also performed gender affirming surgery.

In 1933, while Hirschfeld was away on tour, Hitler's brownshirts broke into his institute and burned his collection of literature, over 20k books, including many rare books that were hard or impossible to replace.

Hitler also raged against the "vice" of homosexuality and the "degenerate" lives of "transsexuals".
