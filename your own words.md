When [[note-taking]], don't just copy notes to skip actually having to think about them. Don't copy a text and call it a day. There's no [[learning]] happening, and you're not [[make connections|making connections]].

Read with intention, and write down the note in your own words. But don't forget to [[write for your future self]]
