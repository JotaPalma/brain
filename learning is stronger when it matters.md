Source: [[ðŸ“• Make It Stick]]

it's a [[quote]] from the book.

When we have an attachment to the subject we're [[learning|learning]], we're bound to learn it better and for longer. We deal better with concrete and personal subjects rather than abstract ones.

The stronger your connection to what you're [[learning]], the more motivated you are and the more likely you have to have a background to help you learn, as [[all new learning requires a foundation of prior knowledge]]
