- It’s a [[personal knowledge management]] tool
- Consists of taking notes, tagging them and making bidirectional links between them, to make connections.
- Adding new knowledge to your existing knowledge, to create ideas.
- German for “Note Box” Niklas Luhmann, a german sociologist.
- [[smart notes]]: Make [[fleeting notes]] on the go. Just write every idea down as it comes to you. On paper, on Notion, phone notes, whatever. Just jot it down. Think of yourself as a collector of ideas. Jot down the source for everything.
- Tag your notes, [[categories are important]]
- Find out which notes to keep as [[permanent notes]]. Compare them to the notes you already have with the same tags.
- [[This]] gives you a method to make connections, indexing and recalling
- [[Notes]] communicate with one another to create connections.


> A Zettelkasten is a personal tool for thinking and [[writing]]. It has hypertextual features to make a web of [[pensamento|thought]] possible. The difference to other systems is that you create a web of [[pensamento|thoughts]] instead of notes of arbitrary size and form, and emphasize connection, not a collection

- According to Niklas Luhmann’s paper on the zettelkasten, it gets to a point where it’s its own entity. It’s got a separate way of thinking and can answer questions in a non-[[linear thinking]] way
- The zettelkasten is compensating for the faults in our brains. It works in a way similar to it, but it doesn’t have the faults a biological brain does.
- Relating to [[systems thinking]], the more we write on our zettelkasten, the more useful it becomes. It grows and improves and is easier to use.
