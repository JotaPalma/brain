Emergence is the [[concept]] of new qualities forming that the components don't have on their own.

It is the result being greater than the sum of its parts.

Example: water is wet, but neither hydrogen nor oxygen are. Only when they interact with each other and the world around them in a certain way, does this quality emerge.
