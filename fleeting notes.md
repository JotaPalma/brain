Source [[ðŸ“• How to Take Smart Notes]]

In [[note-taking]], fleeting notes should be taken any time, anywhere.

Always carry some [[writing]] material with you so that you can take notes. Doesn't matter if it's [[permanent note]]-worthy or not. [[don't trust your present self]]. Try to combine all of them into one place, that you'll call inbox.

Be as clear and concise as you can, [[write for your future self]].

At the end of the day, or ASAP, process your notes, think on them, write permanent notes and store them in your [[second brain]] or [[Zettelkasten]], or into a reference system (for  [[litnotes]])

Toss the fleeting notes that were already processed, so that you can have a clean workspace. Try to achieve [[inbox zero]]
