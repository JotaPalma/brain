Source: [[my second brain in notion]]; [[📕 How to Take Smart Notes]]


- Books, podcasts, YouTube videos. Everything I want my future self to remember is worth it to store.
- Capture what surprises you, because it’s likely that it’s new to you, or interesting.
- [[don’t trust your present self]], create with your future self in mind
- Instead of just capturing something without context, highlight the important parts, and comment on what it means to you.
- Don’t brainstorm for a new topic. Instead, look at the topics you already have and expand on them. New topics will arise.
- Be selective in reading and [[note-taking]], but the selection criterion is whether it adds to a discussion already present in the [[zettelkasten]]. Does it connect? Is it open to connections?
